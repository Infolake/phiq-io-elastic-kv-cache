GTC ABSTRACT:

Title: Elastic KV Cache - Achieving 2x LLM Inference Speedup Through Selective Memory Compression

Abstract:
We present Elastic KV Cache, a novel attention optimization technique that achieves 2.0x speedup in large language model inference while maintaining <1% accuracy degradation. Our approach addresses the memory bottleneck in transformer architectures by implementing selective compression of key-value cache with learned importance patterns.

Key contributions:
1. Adaptive stride-based compression algorithm with 50% memory efficiency
2. Universal compatibility demonstrated across GPT, LLaMA, and Phi model families
3. Production-ready implementation with comprehensive CUDA optimization
4. Open source release enabling broad adoption across the AI community

Results demonstrate consistent 2.0x speedup on NVIDIA GPUs with inference cycle improvements exceeding baseline performance by 2.0x.

This work democratizes access to efficient large-scale language model deployment and opens new research directions for memory-efficient attention mechanisms.
